(4) Thus far two courses of action have been suggested,

- one by Decimus Silanus and the other by Caius Oaesar.
The former thinks that criminals should be put to death;
the latter favors confiscation of property and imprison·
ment ²for life, because the gods did not ordain death as⁸
a punishment, but as a rest from4 toil· and trouble.

(5) Now if you follow⁶ Caius Gaesar's plan, I am in-
clined to think that I shall sear· popular opposition⁶ less3
and yet I hope that you will consult your own opinions
rather than my danger. Since even the proposer ol the
Semproniam law· was himself put to death by command
of the people, (6) Ι shall not sear· the charge of cruelty,
if you adopt⁷ the plau of Silanus. Although what can
be too cruel a punishment⁸ for those who wishcd⁹ to burn·
the city, slaughter' the citizens, and set up the race of
the Allobroges on the ruins of the empire?

(7) There are some who are fearful that all orders ¹⁰will
not unite lltopreservc and defend the republic, but I assure
you that all men are vying with each other in patriotismff.
(8) Even the slaves, aroused to the defence¹³ ofthe city,
shudder at the rcohlessness of the wretches¹⁴ who do not
devote themselves to the common safety. ¹

Such being the case, see to it that you do not fail those
who never yet¹⁵ failed you. (9) Our country is beset
by the torches and weapons of an impious conspiracy.
Whether your temples and your shrines, your hearths and
your homes⁸, shall remain¹⁶, or whether the whole⁸ republic
shall be destroyed¹⁶, llit is for us to decide this very day.
