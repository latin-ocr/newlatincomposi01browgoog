This Series contains the Latin authors usually read iu American
schools and colleges, and also others well adapted to class-soom
use, but not heretoiore published in suitable editions. The several
volumes are prepared by special editors, who aim ιο revise the
text careiully and ιο edit it in the most serviceable manner.

Where there are German editions oi unusual merit, representing
years oi special study under the most favorable circumstances,
these are used, with the consent oi the foreign editor, as a basis
ior the American edition. In this way it is possible to bring out
text-books oi the highest excellence in'a comparatively short period
oi time.

The editions are oi two kinds, conforming to the different
· methods oi studying Latin in our best institutione. Some contain
ln the introductione and commentary such a careiul and minute
treatment oi the author's lile, language, and style as to afford the
means ior a thorough appreciation oi the author and his place in
Latin literature. Others aim merely to assist the student to a good
reading knowledge oi the author, and hare only the text aud briei
explanatory notes at the bottom oi each page. The latter are
particularly acceptable for sight reading, aud for rapid reading
aiter the minute study of an author or period in one pi the fuller
editions. For instance, aiter a class has read a play or two oi
Plautus and Terence careiully, with special reference to the pecu-
liarities of style, language‚ matres, the methods oi presentiug a
play, and the like, these editions will be admirably suited ior the
rapid reading oi other plays.

The Series also contains various supplementary works prepared
by competent scholars. Ererr edort is made to give the books a
remansurorum appearance.
