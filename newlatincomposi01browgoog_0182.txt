companied hythe significant word lo: hc pave me the hooh; he
camera Cercar. In Latin, the dative must be used in these cases.

2. Notice also that often, where iu Latin the dative oi the in-
direct obieci would be used, the objectiva, or the objectiva witha
preposition other than to, is used in English. See 88. c, c.

3. It is well to remember that some verbs with similar mean-
ings to those here classiiied as “special ” are transitive and iol-

lowed by the accusatives laedo, injure, iubeb, command, 111νό,
help, and others.
