fended. (9) 111 Lucullus had been able to capture² the
king, the war would ⁸110 longer be a great one3 but now
Mithridates, ⁴although 0000ὗ conquered, has been assisted
by so many tribes and nations 11101 Glabrio, our new
general, must undertahe a struggle with a powerful and
victorious foe.

(10) It seemsthen that we must put in charge 01 this war
⁶some one who has all the qualities 01 0 great commander,
who has been a soldier from his youth, and whose experi-
enoe in warfare has been extensive⁷ and suocessful⁸
(11) That Cnaeus Pompey is ⁰such a man, many lands
freed from dreadful danger by his prowess aud many
ports onoe¹⁰ swarming with pirates are witnesses.

(12) Only a short time ago you, whose ancestors used
to make war far from horne, had to oontend· with pirates
at the mouth 01 the Tibur. Whose valor is it which in
so short a time has swept¹¹ the freebooters from the
sea and has given to us hope ¹²in plaoe 01 universal
despair?

(13) ¹⁸1f we compare Pompey with other generals, we
shall understand how great his genius is. No sale¹⁴ 01
centurionships, no lust for publio money, has ever in
Pompey's ease brought disaster upon us¹⁶3 nor have his
armies ever harmed our friends or allies. (14) So great⁸
is his selfoontrolthat foreign nations have begun to
understand that our ancestors excelled in power because
they were like¹⁰ Pompey, - not only men 01 energy and
valor, but also of dignity and honor.
