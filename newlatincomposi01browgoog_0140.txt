odium3 but he is not innocent, aud 10 three days you
will be complaining ¹because I let· him go away.

(8) But ²let us speak 01 those who do not 0110111· them· 1
salves to he enemies⁸3 01 those whom I yet desire 10000-
ciliate, although they 010 unwilling ⁸t0 take my advice.

First, there are the rich who are deeply in debt and
who expect hythe favor 01 Catilina that their property
will be saved⁴. (9) Then there is the class 01 11100 har-
assed by debt, who think to obtain· power even anrid the

ashes 01 this beautiful city. The third class is composed⁵
01 Sulla's colonists, who 010 arousing in 0011010100011)1
men hopes 010 proscription. (10) The other* classes 010
made up 01 poor debtors, assassius, and shameless men,
whom I shall not recall from Catilina.

(11) We are supplied with cverything 'which they

lack. On 0110 side are your consuls and generals3 ou the
other, that exhausted gladiator; on one side, the flower
and strength 01 011 Italy3 011 the other, a gang 01 disabled
outcasts. (12) Since this is the case, I have so· arranged
that the colonies and towns can easily be defended

Finally⁸,I cannot iorget that, although those whom
Catilina has lesuin the city are enemies⁸, they are also
citizens. To these Ι say, “Know that the consuls are
watchful, aud 11 you 10010811109011011001011011111100011101
your country, we shall immediately' (10100111.”

(13) Do you then, fellow citizens, 00101 upon this con-
test¹⁰ 11relying not on human devices but on the godo, who
iu person will defend this fair city ¹²against the impious
attacks 01 wicked men.
