Scipio heard that Hannibal was in Gaul and at onoc
sent a few horsemen to learn what he was doing. Lac
lius, who was in command 01 these soldiers, left camp at
the third hour. When he had marched four days} he
came to a large river. Having crossed this by a bridge,
he pitohed camp. Laelius thoright that his men could
not heattacked 'by the, enemy, because the camp was
surronnded by such a wide rivcr that thc latter could

not cross it„ ,

Upon this point Ι will not say more at present. Last
01 all thcrc was the fact that a seasonable return from
this region rather than a longer advanoe was sought
hy our soldiers. Mithridates, on the other hand, had
strengthened tho army which had been collected from
his own kingdom, and was aidcd by the forces 01 many
kings and nations. Now we have observed that it is
wont to happen that the misfortunes 01 kings easily win
the aid 01 many, especially 01 those who either are kings
or live in a kingdom, so that the royal name seems to be
great and holy.
