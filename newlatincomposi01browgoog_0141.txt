ΟΑΤΙΙΙΝΕ ΙΙΙ

(1) Fellow citizens, the ¹especial favor of the immortal
gods has snatched this fair land² of curs from the great-
est⁸ danger, and ³has made this a day which will always
be memorable⁴ in the republic.

As⁶ you do not know· how great the perils are from
which this city has been saved, Ι must tell· you what
(2) Ι “have been doing since⁷ Catiline went away.

⁸Aiter spending days and rights in watching, Ι finally
learned· that certain Gauls lwere going to'cross the Mul·
vian bridge last· night, and that Titus Volturcius would
be with¹⁰ them and would have letters for Catiline.
llWhen Ι had explained the matter to the praetors, they
secretly led many men to the bridge and (3) arrested
Volturcius and the Allobroges, 1²Gabinius, Statilius,
Cethegus and Lentulus were straightway summoned to
me, and Ι then laid the whole matter before the senate.

(4) The Gauls and Volturcius testified that Catilius
and the city leaders were about to burn⁸ the city and
slaughter the citizens, and that Cethegus wished· to do
this before the Saturnalia.

(5) Then the tablets of each one were brought forth
and read. Although¹³ Lentulus acknowledged his scal,
he denied his guilt⁸3 but finally, overwhelmed by the
power⁸ of conscience, he was forced¹⁴ to confess· all that
had been charged against him. His associates¹⁶1⁶wish
stealthy glances at each other likewise confessed.
